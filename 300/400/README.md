# 400 - Step 4: Installing the update

Since we updated the version number in our ```config.yaml```, Home Assistant will show an update button when looking at the add-on details. You might have to refresh your browser or click the "Check for updates" button in the add-on store for it to show up. If you did not update the version number, you can also uninstall and install the add-on again. After installing the add-on again, make sure you start it.

Now navigate to ```http://homeassistant.local:8000``` to see our server in action!

**NOTE**: You may need to use the **IP address** or **hostname** of Home Assistant instead of ```homeassistant.local```.
